					All which are given by the<span class="ref" data-verses="2 Timothy 3:16">e</span> inspiration of God, to be the rule of Faith and Life.

				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					<span class="paragraph-number" id="chapter-1-paragraph-3">3.</span>
					The Books commonly called Apocrypha not being of<span class="ref" data-verses="Luke 24:44; Romans 3:2;">f</span> Divine inspiration, are no part of the Canon (or rule) of the Scripture, and therefore are of no authority to the Church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved or made use of, then other humane writings.
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					<span class="paragraph-number" id="chapter-1-paragraph-4">4.</span>
					The Authority of the Holy Scripture for which it ought to be believed dependeth not upon the testimony of any man, or Church; but wholly upon<span class="ref" data-verses="2 Peter 1:19, 20, 21; 2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 John 5:9;">g</span> God (who is truth it self) the Author thereof; therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God.
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					<span class="paragraph-number" id="chapter-1-paragraph-5">5.</span>
					We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the Church of God, to an high and reverent esteem of the Holy Scriptures; and the heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the Doctrine, and the Majesty of the stile, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is to give all glory to God) the full discovery it makes of the only way of mans salvation, and many other incomparable Excellencies, and intire perfections thereof, are arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence it self to be the Word of God; yet notwithstanding; our<span class="ref" data-verses="John 16:13, 14; 1 Corinthians 2:10, 11, 12; 1 John 2:2, 20, 27">h</span> full perswasion, and assurance of the infallible truth, and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit, bearing witness by and with the Word in our Hearts.
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					<span class="paragraph-number" id="chapter-1-paragraph-6">6.</span>
					The whole Councel of God concerning all things<span class="ref" data-verses="2 Timothy 3:15, 16, 17; Galatians 1:8, 9;">i</span> necessary for his own Glory, Mans Salvation, Faith and Life, is either expressely set down or necessarily contained in the Holy Scripture; unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new Revelation of the Spirit, or traditions of men.
					<br/>
					Nevertheless we acknowledge the<span class="ref" data-verses="John 6:45; 1 Corinthians 2:9, 10, 11, 12;">j</span> inward illumination of the Spirit of God, to be necessary for the saving understanding of such things as are revealed in the Word, and that there are some circumstances concerning the worship of God, and government of the Church common to humane actions and societies; which are to be (l) ordered by the light of nature, and Christian prudence according to the general rules of the Word, which are always to be observed.
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					<span class="paragraph-number" id="chapter-1-paragraph-7">7.</span>
					All things in Scripture are not alike<span class="ref" data-verses="2 Peter 3:16;">k</span> plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all; yet those things which are necessary to be known, believed, and observed for Salvation, are so<span class="ref" data-verses="Psalms 19:7; 119:130;">l</span> clearly propounded, and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of ordinary means, may attain to a sufficient understanding of them.
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					<span class="paragraph-number" id="chapter-1-paragraph-8">8.</span>
					The Old Testament in<span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 3:2;">m</span> Hebrew, (which was the Native language of the people of God of old) and the New Testament in Greek (which at the time of the writing of it was most generally known to the Nations being immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and Providence kept pure in all Ages, are therefore<span class="ref" data-verses="Isaiah 8:20;">n</span> authentical; so as in all controversies of Religion the Church is finally to appeal unto them<span class="ref" data-verses="Acts 15:15;">o</span> But because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have a right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded in the fear of God to read<span class="ref" data-verses="John 5:39;">p</span> and search them, therefore they are to be translated into the vulgar language of every Nation, unto which they<span class="ref" data-verses="1 Corinthians 14:6, 9, 11, 12, 24, 28;">q</span> come, that the Word of God dwelling<span class="ref" data-verses="Colossians 3:16;">r</span> plentifully in all, they may worship him in an acceptable manner, and through patience and comfort of the Scriptures may have hope.
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					<span class="paragraph-number" id="chapter-1-paragraph-9">9.</span>
					The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the<span class="ref" data-verses="2 Peter 1:20, 21; Acts 15:15, 16;">s</span> Scripture it self: And therefore when there is a question about the true and full sense of any Scripture (which is not manifold but one) it must be searched by other places that speak more clearly.
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					<span class="paragraph-number" id="chapter-1-paragraph-10">10.</span>
					The supream judge by which all controversies of Religion are to be determined, and all Decrees of Councels, opinions of antient Writers, Doctrines of men, and private Spirits, are to be examined, and in whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy Scripture delivered by the Spirit, into which<span class="ref" data-verses="Matthew 22:29, 31; Ephesians 2:20; Acts 28:23;">t</span> Scripture so delivered, our faith is finally resolved.

The Promises of it likewise shew them Gods approbation of Obedience, and what blessings they may expect upon the performance thereof, though not as due to them by the Law as a Covenant of Works; so as mans doing Good and refraining from Evil, because the Law incourageth to the one and deterreth from the other, is no Evidence of his being<span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 6:12, 13, 14; 1 Peter 3:-13;">p</span> under the Law and not under Grace.
